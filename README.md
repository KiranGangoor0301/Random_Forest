# Random Forest Algorithm Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for deploying the Random Forest algorithm on GitHub.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X)
- Libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas (install using `pip`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KiranGangoor0301/Random_Forest/blob/main/random_forest.py
   cd random-forest-deployment
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Training the Model:**

   Modify `train_random_forest.py` to preprocess data and train the Random Forest model.

2. **Saving the Model:**

   Save the trained model using `joblib` or another library. Update `save_model.py`.

3. **Deployment:**

   Choose a deployment method based on your use case:
   
   - As a RESTful API using Flask/FastAPI.
   - In a web app using Django/React.
   - Containerized with Docker.
